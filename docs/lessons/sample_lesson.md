# Introduction to TypeScript

In this lesson, we will learn the basics of TypeScript.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing. TypeScript is designed for large-scale

## Prerquisites

Before we start, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, you need to install it first. You can install TypeScript using npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

## Your First TypeScript Program

Let's write a simple TypeScript program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```typescript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Save the above code to a file named `hello.ts`. To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript, run the following command:

```bash
tsc hello.ts
```

The above command will generate a file named `hello.js`. You can run the JavaScript code using Node.js:

```bash
node hello.js
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned the basics of TypeScript. TypeScript is a powerful language that brings static typing to JavaScript.

## Steps to get started

1. Fork this template repository to your own GitHub account and open it in Codespaces.
2. Install the TypeScript package.
3. Create a TypeScript configuration file.
4. Convert `index.js` to `index.tsx`.
5. Convert `App.js` to `App.tsx`.
6. Run the TypeScript compiler.
7. Commit and push your changes.
8. Start a discussion in the Discussions tab of this repository.

- **lesson_id**: A unique identifier for the lesson. This is used to generate the lesson URL.
- **title**: The title of the lesson.
- **description**: A short description of the lesson.
- **content**: The content of the lesson. This can be written in Markdown format.
- **steps**: A list of steps to follow in the lesson.
- **next_lesson**: The ID of the next lesson in the sequence. This is used to generate the "Next Lesson" button at the end of the lesson.

The lesson content can include text, code blocks, images, links, and other Markdown elements. The lesson content is displayed on the lesson page in the order it is written in the lesson file.

## Step 2: Create a Lesson Component

Next, we need to create a React component that will display the lesson content. Create a new file named `Lesson.js` in the `src/components` directory and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Lesson = ({ lesson }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{lesson.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: lesson.content }} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Lesson;
```

In this component, we are rendering the lesson title and content using the `lesson` prop. We are using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop to render the lesson content as HTML.

## Step 3: Add a Route for the Lesson Component

To display the lesson component in the application, we need to add a route for the lesson page. Open the `src/App.js` file and add the following code:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Lesson from './components/Lesson';
import lessons from './lessons';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        {lessons.map((lesson) => (
          <Route key={lesson.id} path={`/lessons/${lesson.id}`}>
            <Lesson lesson={lesson} />
          </Route>
        ))}
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this code, we are mapping over the `lessons` array and creating a route for each lesson using the lesson ID. When the user navigates to a lesson URL, the `Lesson` component will be rendered with the corresponding

## Code Challenge
Create a new lesson in the `lessons` directory with the following content:

```markdown
---
lesson_id: 2
title: Introduction to React
description: Learn the basics of React.

  # Introduction to React

  In this lesson, we will learn the basics of React.

  ## What is React?

  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

  ## Prerequisites

  Before we start, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  ## Getting Started

  To get started with React, you need to install it first. You can install React using npm:

  ```bash
  npm install react react-dom
  ```

  ## Your First React Component

  Let's write a simple React component that renders "Hello, World!" to the screen:

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';

  const App = () => {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  };

  export default App;
  ```

  Save the above code to a file named `App.js`. You can render the `App` component in your `index.js` file.

  ## Conclusion

  In this lesson, we learned the basics of React. React is a powerful library for building interactive user interfaces.

  ## Next Steps

  To learn more about React, visit the official [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

```

After creating the lesson file, add a route for the new lesson in the `App.js` file.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple e-learning platform using React. We created a lesson component to display lesson content and added routes to navigate between lessons. You can extend this application by adding features like user authentication, quizzes, and progress tracking. Happy coding! ðŸš€
